Proposed method:
	- Parse every word on the page.
	- Save its translation if not available

Proposed usage:
	- Select a word / string
	- Initiate Translation
		+ Right click to translate 
		  potentially slow / invasive
		+ Alt / Option Keybinding
		  Perhaps a little hidden

Why does this exist?
	- Current methods are very intrusive
	- Existing solutions are heavy and slow
	- Reliable implementations are smaller features of a larger product
	- Reading articles in a different language is a great way to learn a new language

This is the current project

I should really stop with this #TODOs business and just shift over to issues.
